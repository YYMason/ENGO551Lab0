            <p> <b>How does the NBA All-Star voting process work?</b></p>
            <p>
                The fan vote accounts for 50 percent of the total vote to determine the starters for the NBA All-Star Game. 
                Current players and media members split the other 50 percent.
                Each ballot consists of two guards and three frontcourt players from each conference.
                Reserves are chosen by NBA head coaches, and league commissioner Adam Silver chooses injury replacements if necessary.
                All-Star captains will then draft their teams from the eligible pool of players (starters in first round, reserves in second round). 
                Captains will be selected based on which players earn the most fan votes in each conference. 
                They are not required to draft based on conference affiliation or position.</p>
